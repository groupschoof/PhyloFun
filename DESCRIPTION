Description: PhyloFun is a pipeline which generates a maximum likelihood
phylogenetic tree for each query protein and treats this tree as a Bayesian
Network. Gene Ontology (GO) term annotations are passed from homologous
proteins to the query using Judea Pearl's message passing algorithm provided by
the package gRain. The result is an annotated high quality phylogenetic tree
with confidence values and the inferred GO terms for the query protein.
PhyloFun is fast and relyable. It can be applied to whole genomes.
