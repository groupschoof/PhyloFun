h2. Abstract

Protein function has often been transferred from characterized proteins to novel proteins based on sequence similarity, e.g. using the best BLAST hit. Based on the SIFTER phylogenomic tool (1), we use a statistical inference algorithm to propagate e.g. Gene Ontology (GO) terms inside a phylogenetic tree, scoring branch length, evidence codes of GO annotations and speciation vs. duplication nodes. Including additional information like Interpro domains improves predictions. This allows us to integrate multiple data types in a consistent framework.

In order to generate accurate phylogenetic trees that contain a maximum of functional information at reasonable computational costs, we implemented a reusable workflow that, for a given input protein, searches candidate orthologs with known functions, adds paralogs so that duplications can be detected reliably and builds a phylogenetic tree from a filtered multiple alignment. This tree is then used as input to the inference algorithm which outputs, for each protein in the tree, a probability for assigning each GO term occurring in the tree.

We call this new phylogenomic workflow for protein function prediction *PhyloFun*.
